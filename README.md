Data Science Final Project - NBA HOF Prediction

Did this project as part of my Data Science course.
The project is about trying to predict whether an NBA player will be inducted into the Hall Of Fame list based on different categories.
To do so we did the following:
* Data Scraping (using beautiful soup and Selenium)
* Data Cleaning with pandas
* EDA - visualizing the data
* Machine Learning (using sickit module)
